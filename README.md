## PA2-Starter

1. main.py is the driver code that has to be run in order to run different set of experiments
2. run get_cifar100data.sh to download the data. The dataset will be downloaded in 'data' directory 
3. config files need to be in the 'config' directory
4. You are free to create new functions, change existing function
signatures, add/remove member variables/functions in the provided classes but you need to maintain the overall given structure 
of the code. Specifically, you have to mandatorily use the classes provided in neuralnet.py to create your model (although, 
like already mentioned, you can  add or remove variables/functions in these classes or change the function signatures)
5. We have marked sections to be implemented by you as TODO for your convenience
